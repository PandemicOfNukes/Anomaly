Adam

He is the top investor of Dream Game Labs.

He believes that whatever the cost we should make is money back even if the product isn't
finished yet.

Who is he? Well I know him but at the same time I don't... A Intelligent human without the
doubt but with no feelings... is he a psychopath? or a sociopath?

I don't know...

He is a mystery...

Yet still to solve.


Update:

I got a recording of a phone call we made to his "boss".

Turns out Dream Game Labs is owned by a parent company called "DREAM" they do research on
Anomalies they say they try to "Cure" the stone that is in all of our brains since the 
explosion on the artic in 1944.

I hope they don't find this FileServer if they find out im in trouble.

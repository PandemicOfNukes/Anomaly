[START OF MESSAGE]

Dr. Carter,

Elizabeth condition is Stable and slowly improving, she already shows some types of emotions
and talks a bit more but from now on I predict that the situation from now on will only
be slowly improving and not the "fast" improvements that we hoped.

Keep in mind that Elizabeth is suffering from a trauma since the incident that killed your
wife and she was there when it all happened.

But don't be discoraged by the slow improvements lets all remember that Elizabeth was showing
signs of Severe Depression and Phobia with cars and she wouldn't talk or show emotions so
these improvements are huge to the complete recovery of Elizabeth.

My advice is that she continues to come to our sessions, continue with the medication and
more importantly give her lots of love.

Have a rest good day.

Sincerely,
Dr. Maria
